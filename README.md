# DJANGO_PROJECTS

This repository contains all my recently developed Django projects.

## Projects

1. **Django Steam Clone**: This project is a clone of the popular digital distribution platform, Steam, built using Django.

## Setup

To run these projects on your local environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your computer:

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

``` 
python -m venv venv venv/bin/activate
# On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the dependencies for each project:

 ```
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Apply the database migrations and start the development server:
