## Setup

To run these projects on your local environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your computer:

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

  - Creating a Enviroment : <b> python -m venv venv </b> <br/>

  - Activating a Enviroment : source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use "venv\Scripts\activate" <br/> <br/>

3. Install the dependencies for each project:

  - Inside a project folder use : pip install -r requirements.txt <br/> <br/>

4. Apply the database migrations and start the development server:
